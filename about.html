   	    <p>Hey guys! My name is Conner Place, and I run the Phantom Coasters channel on youtube. On the channel I post all kinds of various roller coaster videos, including but not limited to reviews, K’NEX roller coasters, countdowns, and analysis’! I also have a discord server that you can join at the link below. If you’re looking for a place to expand your roller coaster knowledge while also learning more about my opinions on coasters, then my channel is for you!<p>
